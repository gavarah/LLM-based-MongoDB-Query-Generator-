# LLM based MongoDB Query Generator Streamlit App

This is a Streamlit application for the LLM based MongoDB Query Generator workflow.

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Workflow

1.  **Configuration**: Connect to your MongoDB instance.
2.  **Schema Mapping**: Select two collections and map their fields. The mapping is saved to a local SQLite database (`app_data.db`).
3.  **Query Input**: Enter a natural language query.
4.  **Plan Review**: Review the plan generated by the (mock) Planner Agent.
5.  **Execution & Validation**: The app executes the query and validates the results (mocked for now).

## Notes

-   **Mock Agents**: The `PlannerAgent` and `ValidationAgent` classes in `app.py` are currently placeholders. You should replace the logic inside `plan()` and `validate()` with your actual agent calls.
-   **MongoDB**: You need a running MongoDB instance to use the mapping feature fully. If you don't have one, the connection step will fail.
